# Python Based battery optimization system 
Welcome to my M-Tech final project which is built on Python-based optimization of Li-ion batteries 
This project area is trying to cater a problem to the general students, researchers, industries to have a system of Python which needs **zero cost** to run high level objective functions like NSGA-II. It requires no such technical abilities to have this on your system. This is the basic framework that has been built for the project.
The project tries to cater 
1. Running a high level battery simulation on Python - courtesy : PyBamm
2. Having a same optimization framework module there itself 
3. Having a less system load
